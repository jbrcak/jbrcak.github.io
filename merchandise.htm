            <dd>Conscientous of your impact of the environment or simply
            Arbor Day themed variety of recycled materials. Not all
            materials can be easily recycled so an odd twist on charms
            and decor takes recycling's reuse motto into play.</dd>

            When outdoors, climbing, hiking or spulunking
            it can be dangerous to have loose jewelry but this is a 
            touch of style to your rough gear with the doubled purpose 
            of emergency rope should the need arise.</dd>

            <dd>A touch of Spring, Summer, Fall or Winter for all wrist
             circumferences. Inspired by the seasons, and no year ever 
             being quite the same.</dd>

            <dd>Each hat is custom made to your proportions which we ask 
            for you to specify. Recommended to order a months before a 
            specific holiday for your own

            do our best and will offer rushed delivery options.</dd>

              <dd>Limited supply of more decorated and embelished
              series ogf hats for people looking to go out of their way for an
              extra accent. We do warn, these hats wil be rather unusual either 
              by styles of another decade or be more heavy. They will only be
              occassionally available as it may take an unusually long time to make
              and come in a more limited scale of sizes
              <br />
              We will post additional requirements and tips to bypassing having to
              return and exchange should one be planning to say wear a fancy bun.
              Expect to have more in depth contact for measurements and conditions
              via e-mail if ordering for the next two weeks. Order a month in advance
               if possible.</dd>

              <dd>For cosplayers or anyone looking for a twist.

            condition for reuse or with minor fixes needed. Adding to the
